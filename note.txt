* The idea how big picture of game shoud look like * 

    grafic_proc <-- cancas(px, py, h, w, drovable_vecotr) <-- structure_converter <-- ctx_struct <-- Game logic
                                 .update(drovable_vecotr) 





* The multi_level generaithing data.
    - Tile_field can be duplicate for each level of drawing. Data can be put 
    on the queue and after that will be draw.
    - Secound options can be grate complexity of tile_field behavior. 





This is the main idea for my renderer. We need the sprite_list. Interface for it
and the render fucntion what can draw in porper posytion in the screan proper
sprite.

- List can be create dynamicly but only once. After that some value will be put
  there by index. This method shrink needed alocation operation.

/*
    sprite_list {
        size
        node *head;
    }


    add_sprite(sprite_list, new_sprite);
    renderer(sprite_list);
